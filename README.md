# DodgeTheEnemies

An experiment. Well yes, this game is just an experiment. The experiment in question wants to answer this question: is it possible to make a video game from scratch without using a game engine? The answer is that it takes a lot of work. This game is the result of a couple of months of work, in free time.

The game was written entirely in native Kotlin without using a real gameEngine such as libGDX or similar. The game is available on the playstore for all those who want to try it.
This represents the public version of the game. Everything present can be safely copied and reused elsewhere, including images.
